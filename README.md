This is a SPA allowing two players to play tic tac toe. I decided to build
out the front-end first, then do the token auth API work to allow users to
sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. From there, I moved on to the
game logic and took it step by step. My problem-solving process was to use
pseudo code to map out a plan for a step, get one portion of that step to work,
test, save, commit and move on to the next problem. I also utilized classmates,
instructors, and online resources.

Unsolved problems:
WinCheck function needs to work for tie.
Reset game functionality needs to be built.
Display for wins / losses needs to be implemented.
Game API set up needs to be done.
Create more modular code files.

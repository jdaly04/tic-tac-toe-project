https://jdaly04.github.io/tic-tac-toe-project/

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML
Bootstrap
Sass
JavaScript
JQuery
Ajax

This is a SPA allowing two players to play tic tac toe. I decided to build
out the front-end first, then do the token auth API work to allow users to
sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. From there, I moved on to the
game logic and took it step by step. My problem-solving process was to use
pseudo code to map out a plan for an indiividual step, work on the actual code
for that step, test, and iterate until successful. Then, move on to the next
step. I'd save, commit and move on to the next problem. I also utilized
classmates, instructors, and online resources for problem-solving and debugging.
By end of project work-time, I was able to much more efficiently problem-solve
on my own by isolating small problems, making one change, checking with debuggers
and console.logs to pin-point problem.

Future enhancements:
Create more modular code files, specifically to separate out some of game logic
and events.

  USER STORIES:

 As a user, I want to have the game keep track of my scores during each session.
 As a user, I want to have a working game board that tells me the score.
 As a user, I want to have my user name saved as well as my current game history.
 As a user, I want there to be a notification when somebody wins.
 As the administrator, I want this game to hold my user's scores in a database
 that can be accessed whenever the person is signed in.
 As the administrator, I want there to be an option for the user's password to

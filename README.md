This is a SPA allowing two players to play tic tac toe. I decided to build
out the front-end first, then do the token auth API work to allow users to
sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. From there, I moved on to the
game logic and took it step by step. My problem-solving process was to use
pseudo code to map out a plan for an indiividual step, work on the actual code
for that step, test, and iterate until successful. Then, move on to the next
step. I'd save, commit and move on to the next problem. I also utilized
classmates, instructors, and online resources for problem-solving and debugging.
By end of project work-time, I was able to much more efficiently problem-solve
on my own by isolating small problems, making one change, checking with debuggers
and console.logs to pin-point problem.

Future enhancements:
Create more modular code files, specifically to separate out some of game logic
and events.
